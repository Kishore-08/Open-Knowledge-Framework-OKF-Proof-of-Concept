## Implicit maintenance-mode deactivation

You can implicitly deactivate the HPA for a target without the
need to change the HPA configuration itself. If the target's desired replica count
is set to 0, and the HPA's minimum replica count is greater than 0, the HPA
stops adjusting the target (and sets the `ScalingActive` Condition on itself
to `false`) until you reactivate it by manually adjusting the target's desired
replica count or HPA's minimum replica count.
