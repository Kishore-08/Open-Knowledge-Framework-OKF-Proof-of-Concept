### Maximum unavailable Pods

FEATURE STATE:
`Kubernetes v1.35 [beta]`

You can control the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during an update
by specifying the `.spec.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable` field.
The value can be an absolute number (for example, `5`) or a percentage of desired
Pods (for example, `10%`). Absolute number is calculated from the percentage value
by rounding it up. This field cannot be 0. The default setting is 1.

This field applies to all Pods in the range `0` to `replicas - 1`. If there is any
unavailable Pod in the range `0` to `replicas - 1`, it will be counted towards
`maxUnavailable`.

#### Note:

The `maxUnavailable` field is in Beta stage and it is disabled by default.
