### Expanding Persistent Volumes Claims

FEATURE STATE:
`Kubernetes v1.24 [stable]`

Support for expanding PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) is enabled by default. You can expand
the following types of volumes:

- [csi](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi "The Container Storage Interface (CSI) defines a standard interface to expose storage systems to containers.") (including some CSI migrated
  volume types)
- flexVolume (deprecated)
- portworxVolume (deprecated)

You can only expand a PVC if its storage class's `allowVolumeExpansion` field is set to true.

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: example-vol-default
provisioner: vendor-name.example/magicstorage
parameters:
  resturl: "http://192.168.10.100:8080"
  restuser: ""
  secretNamespace: ""
  secretName: ""
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

To request a larger volume for a PVC, edit the PVC object and specify a larger
size. This triggers expansion of the volume that backs the underlying PersistentVolume. A
new PersistentVolume is never created to satisfy the claim. Instead, an existing volume is resized.

#### Warning:

Directly editing the size of a PersistentVolume can prevent an automatic resize of that volume.
If you edit the capacity of a PersistentVolume, and then edit the `.spec` of a matching
PersistentVolumeClaim to make the size of the PersistentVolumeClaim match the PersistentVolume,
then no storage resize happens.
The Kubernetes control plane will see that the desired state of both resources matches,
conclude that the backing volume size has been manually
increased and that no resize is necessary.

#### CSI Volume expansion

FEATURE STATE:
`Kubernetes v1.24 [stable]`

Support for expanding CSI volumes is enabled by default but it also requires a
specific CSI driver to support volume expansion. Refer to documentation of the
specific CSI driver for more information.

#### Resizing a volume containing a file system

You can only resize volumes containing a file system if the file system is XFS, Ext3, or Ext4.

When a volume contains a file system, the file system is only resized when a new Pod is using
the PersistentVolumeClaim in `ReadWrite` mode. File system expansion is either done when a Pod is starting up
or when a Pod is running and the underlying file system supports online expansion.

FlexVolumes (deprecated since Kubernetes v1.23) allow resize if the driver is configured with the
`RequiresFSResize` capability to `true`. The FlexVolume can be resized on Pod restart.

#### Resizing an in-use PersistentVolumeClaim

FEATURE STATE:
`Kubernetes v1.24 [stable]`

In this case, you don't need to delete and recreate a Pod or deployment that is using an existing PVC.
Any in-use PVC automatically becomes available to its Pod as soon as its file system has been expanded.
This feature has no effect on PVCs that are not in use by a Pod or deployment. You must create a Pod that
uses the PVC before the expansion can complete.

Similar to other volume types - FlexVolume volumes can also be expanded when in-use by a Pod.

#### Note:

FlexVolume resize is possible only when the underlying driver supports resize.

#### Recovering from Failure when Expanding Volumes

If a user specifies a new size that is too big to be satisfied by underlying
storage system, expansion of PVC will be continuously retried until user or
cluster administrator takes some action. This can be undesirable and hence
Kubernetes provides following methods of recovering from such failures.



If expanding underlying storage fails, the cluster administrator can manually
recover the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) state and cancel the resize requests.
Otherwise, the resize requests are continuously retried by the controller without
administrator intervention.

1. Mark the PersistentVolume(PV) that is bound to the PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC)
   with `Retain` reclaim policy.
2. Delete the PVC. Since PV has `Retain` reclaim policy - we will not lose any data
