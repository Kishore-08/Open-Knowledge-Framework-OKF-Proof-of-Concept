### My Pods are pending with event message `FailedScheduling`

If the scheduler cannot find any node where a Pod can fit, the Pod remains
unscheduled until a place can be found. An
[Event](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/) is produced
each time the scheduler fails to find a place for the Pod. You can use `kubectl`
to view the events for a Pod; for example:

```
kubectl describe pod frontend | grep -A 9999999999 Events
```

```
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age   From               Message
  ----     ------            ----  ----               -------
  Warning  FailedScheduling  23s   default-scheduler  0/42 nodes available: insufficient cpu
```

In the preceding example, the Pod named "frontend" fails to be scheduled due to
insufficient CPU resource on any node. Similar error messages can also suggest
failure due to insufficient memory (PodExceedsFreeMemory). In general, if a Pod
is pending with a message of this type, there are several things to try:

- Add more nodes to the cluster.
- Terminate unneeded Pods to make room for pending Pods.
- Check that the Pod is not larger than all the nodes. For example, if all the
  nodes have a capacity of `cpu: 1`, then a Pod with a request of `cpu: 1.1` will
  never be scheduled.
- Check for node taints. If most of your nodes are tainted, and the new Pod does
  not tolerate that taint, the scheduler only considers placements onto the
  remaining nodes that don't have that taint.

You can check node capacities and amounts allocated with the
`kubectl describe nodes` command. For example:

```
kubectl describe nodes e2e-test-node-pool-4lw4
```

```

```

In the preceding output, you can see that if a Pod requests more than 1.120 CPUs
or more than 6.23Gi of memory, that Pod will not fit on the node.

By looking at the “Pods” section, you can see which Pods are taking up space on
the node.

The amount of resources available to Pods is less than the node capacity because
system daemons use a portion of the available resources. Within the Kubernetes API,
each Node has a `.status.allocatable` field
(see [NodeStatus](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/node-v1/#NodeStatus)
for details).

The `.status.allocatable` field describes the amount of resources that are available
to Pods on that node (for example: 15 virtual CPUs and 7538 MiB of memory).
