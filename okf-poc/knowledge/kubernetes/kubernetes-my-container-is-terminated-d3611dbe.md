### My container is terminated

Your container might get terminated because it is resource-starved. To check
whether a container is being killed because it is hitting a resource limit, call
`kubectl describe pod` on the Pod of interest:

```
kubectl describe pod simmemleak-hra99
```

The output is similar to:

```
Name:                           simmemleak-hra99

```

In the preceding example, the `Restart Count: 5` indicates that the `simmemleak`
container in the Pod was terminated and restarted five times (so far).
The `OOMKilled` reason shows that the container tried to use more memory than its limit.

Your next step might be to check the application code for a memory leak. If you
find that the application is behaving how you expect, consider setting a higher
memory limit (and possibly request) for that container.
