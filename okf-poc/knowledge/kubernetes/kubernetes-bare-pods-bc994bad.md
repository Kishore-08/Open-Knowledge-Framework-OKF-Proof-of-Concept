### Bare Pods

When the node that a Pod is running on reboots or fails, the pod is terminated
and will not be restarted. However, a Job will create new Pods to replace terminated ones.
For this reason, we recommend that you use a Job rather than a bare Pod, even if your application
requires only a single Pod.
