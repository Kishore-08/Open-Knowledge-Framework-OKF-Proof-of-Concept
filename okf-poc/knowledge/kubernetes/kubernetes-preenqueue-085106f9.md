### PreEnqueue

These plugins are called prior to adding Pods to the internal active queue, where Pods are marked as
ready for scheduling.

Only when all PreEnqueue plugins return `Success`, the Pod is allowed to enter the active queue.
Otherwise, it's placed in the internal unschedulable Pods list, and doesn't get an `Unschedulable` condition.
