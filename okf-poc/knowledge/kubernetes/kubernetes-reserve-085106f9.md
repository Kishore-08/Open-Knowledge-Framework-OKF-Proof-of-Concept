### Reserve

A plugin that implements the Reserve interface has two methods, namely `Reserve`
and `Unreserve`, that back two informational scheduling phases called Reserve
and Unreserve, respectively. Plugins which maintain runtime state (aka "stateful
plugins") should use these phases to be notified by the scheduler when resources
on a node are being reserved and unreserved for a given Pod.

The Reserve phase happens before the scheduler actually binds a Pod to its
designated node. It exists to prevent race conditions while the scheduler waits
for the bind to succeed. The `Reserve` method of each Reserve plugin may succeed
or fail; if one `Reserve` method call fails, subsequent plugins are not executed
and the Reserve phase is considered to have failed. If the `Reserve` method of
all plugins succeed, the Reserve phase is considered to be successful and the
rest of the scheduling cycle and the binding cycle are executed.

The Unreserve phase is triggered if the Reserve phase or a later phase fails.
When this happens, the `Unreserve` method of **all** Reserve plugins will be
executed in the reverse order of `Reserve` method calls. This phase exists to
clean up the state associated with the reserved Pod.

#### Caution:

The implementation of the `Unreserve` method in Reserve plugins must be
idempotent and may not fail.
