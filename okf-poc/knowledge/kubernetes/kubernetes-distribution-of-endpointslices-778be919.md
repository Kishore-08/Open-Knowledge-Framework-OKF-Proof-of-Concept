### Distribution of EndpointSlices

Each EndpointSlice has a set of ports that applies to all endpoints within the
resource. When named ports are used for a Service, Pods may end up with
different target port numbers for the same named port, requiring different
EndpointSlices.

The control plane tries to fill EndpointSlices as full as possible, but does not
actively rebalance them. The logic is fairly straightforward:

1. Iterate through existing EndpointSlices, remove endpoints that are no longer
   desired and update matching endpoints that have changed.
2. Iterate through EndpointSlices that have been modified in the first step and
   fill them up with any new endpoints needed.
3. If there's still new endpoints left to add, try to fit them into a previously
   unchanged slice and/or create new ones.

Importantly, the third step prioritizes limiting EndpointSlice updates over a
perfectly full distribution of EndpointSlices. As an example, if there are 10
new endpoints to add and 2 EndpointSlices with room for 5 more endpoints each,
this approach will create a new EndpointSlice instead of filling up the 2
existing EndpointSlices. In other words, a single EndpointSlice creation is
preferable to multiple EndpointSlice updates.

With kube-proxy running on each Node and watching EndpointSlices, every change
to an EndpointSlice becomes relatively expensive since it will be transmitted to
every Node in the cluster. This approach is intended to limit the number of
changes that need to be sent to every Node, even if it may result with multiple
EndpointSlices that are not full.

In practice, this less than ideal distribution should be rare. Most changes
processed by the EndpointSlice controller will be small enough to fit in an
existing EndpointSlice, and if not, a new EndpointSlice is likely going to be
necessary soon anyway. Rolling updates of Deployments also provide a natural
repacking of EndpointSlices with all Pods and their corresponding endpoints
getting replaced.
