### `List` gRPC endpoint

The `List` endpoint provides information on resources of running pods, with details such as the
id of exclusively allocated CPUs, device id as it was reported by device plugins and id of
the NUMA node where these devices are allocated. Also, for NUMA-based machines, it contains the
information about memory and hugepages reserved for a container.

Starting from Kubernetes v1.27, the `List` endpoint can provide information on resources
of running pods allocated in `ResourceClaims` by the `DynamicResourceAllocation` API.
Starting from Kubernetes v1.34, this feature is enabled by default.

```
// ListPodResourcesResponse is the response returned by List function
message ListPodResourcesResponse {
    repeated PodResources pod_resources = 1;
}

// PodResources contains information about the node resources assigned to a pod
message PodResources {
    string name = 1;
    string namespace = 2;
    repeated ContainerResources containers = 3;
}

// ContainerResources contains information about the resources assigned to a container
message ContainerResources {
    string name = 1;
    repeated ContainerDevices devices = 2;
    repeated int64 cpu_ids = 3;
    repeated ContainerMemory memory = 4;
    repeated DynamicResource dynamic_resources = 5;
}

// ContainerMemory contains information about memory and hugepages assigned to a container
message ContainerMemory {
    string memory_type = 1;
    uint64 size = 2;
    TopologyInfo topology = 3;
}

// Topology describes hardware topology of the resource
message TopologyInfo {
        repeated NUMANode nodes = 1;
}

// NUMA representation of NUMA node
message NUMANode {
        int64 ID = 1;
}

// ContainerDevices contains information about the devices assigned to a container
message ContainerDevices {
    string resource_name = 1;
    repeated string device_ids = 2;
    TopologyInfo topology = 3;
}

// DynamicResource contains information about the devices assigned to a container by Dynamic Resource Allocation
message DynamicResource {
    string class_name = 1;
    string claim_name = 2;
    string claim_namespace = 3;
    repeated ClaimResource claim_resources = 4;
}

// ClaimResource contains per-plugin resource information
message ClaimResource {
    repeated CDIDevice cdi_devices = 1 [(gogoproto.customname) = "CDIDevices"];
}

// CDIDevice specifies a CDI device information
message CDIDevice {
    // Fully qualified CDI device name
    // for example: vendor.com/gpu=gpudevice1
    // see more details in the CDI specification:
    // https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface/blob/main/SPEC.md
    string name = 1;
}
```

#### Note:

cpu\_ids in the `ContainerResources` in the `List` endpoint correspond to exclusive CPUs allocated
to a particular container. If the goal is to evaluate CPUs that belong to the shared pool, the `List`
endpoint needs to be used in conjunction with the `GetAllocatableResources` endpoint as explained
below:

1. Call `GetAllocatableResources` to get a list of all the allocatable CPUs
2. Call `GetCpuIds` on all `ContainerResources` in the system
3. Subtract out all of the CPUs from the `GetCpuIds` calls from the `GetAllocatableResources` call
