### DistinctAttribute constraint

When requesting multiple devices in a ResourceClaim, you can use the DistinctAttribute
constraint to ensure that each allocated device has a different value for a specified
attribute. This constraint was introduced with the consumable capacity feature.

The DistinctAttribute constraint is particularly useful when working with
multiply-allocatable devices. It prevents the scheduler from allocating the same
device multiple times within a single ResourceClaim, even when that device allows
multiple allocations.

Beyond preventing duplicate allocations, this constraint helps optimize performance
by ensuring devices are distributed based on their attributes. For example, you can
use it to distribute devices across different NUMA nodes to optimize memory bandwidth
and reduce contention.
