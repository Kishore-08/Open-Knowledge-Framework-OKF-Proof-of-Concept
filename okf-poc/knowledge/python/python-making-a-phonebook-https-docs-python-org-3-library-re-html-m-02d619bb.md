### Making a Phonebook[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#making-a-phonebook "Link to this heading")

[`split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split "re.split") splits a string into a list delimited by the passed pattern. The
method is invaluable for converting textual data into data structures that can be
easily read and modified by Python as demonstrated in the following example that
creates a phonebook.

First, here is the input. Normally it may come from a file, here we are using
triple-quoted string syntax

```
>>> text = """Ross McFluff: 834.345.1254 155 Elm Street
...
... Ronald Heathmore: 892.345.3428 436 Finley Avenue
... Frank Burger: 925.541.7625 662 South Dogwood Way
...
...
... Heather Albrecht: 548.326.4584 919 Park Place"""
```

The entries are separated by one or more newlines. Now we convert the string
into a list with each nonempty line having its own entry:

```
>>> entries = re.split("\n+", text)
>>> entries
['Ross McFluff: 834.345.1254 155 Elm Street',
'Ronald Heathmore: 892.345.3428 436 Finley Avenue',
'Frank Burger: 925.541.7625 662 South Dogwood Way',
'Heather Albrecht: 548.326.4584 919 Park Place']
```

Finally, split each entry into a list with first name, last name, telephone
number, and address. We use the `maxsplit` parameter of [`split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split "re.split")
because the address has spaces, our splitting pattern, in it:

```
>>> [re.split(":? ", entry, maxsplit=3) for entry in entries]
[['Ross', 'McFluff', '834.345.1254', '155 Elm Street'],
['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892.345.3428', '436 Finley Avenue'],
['Frank', 'Burger', '925.541.7625', '662 South Dogwood Way'],
['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548.326.4584', '919 Park Place']]
```

The `:?` pattern matches the colon after the last name, so that it does not
occur in the result list. With a `maxsplit` of `4`, we could separate the
house number from the street name:

```
>>> [re.split(":? ", entry, maxsplit=4) for entry in entries]
[['Ross', 'McFluff', '834.345.1254', '155', 'Elm Street'],
['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892.345.3428', '436', 'Finley Avenue'],
['Frank', 'Burger', '925.541.7625', '662', 'South Dogwood Way'],
['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548.326.4584', '919', 'Park Place']]
```
