### Dictionary Schema Details[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#dictionary-schema-details "Link to this heading")

The dictionary passed to [`dictConfig()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.dictConfig "logging.config.dictConfig") must contain the following
keys:

- *version* - to be set to an integer value representing the schema
  version. The only valid value at present is 1, but having this key
  allows the schema to evolve while still preserving backwards
  compatibility.

All other keys are optional, but if present they will be interpreted
as described below. In all cases below where a ‘configuring dict’ is
mentioned, it will be checked for the special `'()'` key to see if a
custom instantiation is required. If so, the mechanism described in
[User-defined objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dict-userdef) below is used to create an instance;
otherwise, the context is used to determine what to instantiate.

- *formatters* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each
  key is a formatter id and each value is a dict describing how to
  configure the corresponding [`Formatter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter "logging.Formatter") instance.

  The configuring dict is searched for the following optional keys
  which correspond to the arguments passed to create a
  [`Formatter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter "logging.Formatter") object:

  - `format`
  - `datefmt`
  - `style`
  - `validate` (since version >=3.8)
  - `defaults` (since version >=3.12)

  An optional `class` key indicates the name of the formatter’s
  class (as a dotted module and class name). The instantiation
  arguments are as for [`Formatter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter "logging.Formatter"), thus this key is
  most useful for instantiating a customised subclass of
  `Formatter`. For example, the alternative class
  might present exception tracebacks in an expanded or condensed
  format. If your formatter requires different or extra configuration
  keys, you should use [User-defined objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dict-userdef).
- *filters* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each key
  is a filter id and each value is a dict describing how to configure
  the corresponding Filter instance.

  The configuring dict is searched for the key `name` (defaulting to the
  empty string) and this is used to construct a [`logging.Filter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Filter "logging.Filter")
  instance.
- *handlers* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each
  key is a handler id and each value is a dict describing how to
  configure the corresponding Handler instance.

  The configuring dict is searched for the following keys:

  - `class` (mandatory). This is the fully qualified name of the
    handler class.
  - `level` (optional). The level of the handler.
  - `formatter` (optional). The id of the formatter for this
    handler.
  - `filters` (optional). A list of ids of the filters for this
    handler.

    Changed in version 3.11: `filters` can take filter instances in addition to ids.

  All *other* keys are passed through as keyword arguments to the
  handler’s constructor. For example, given the snippet:

  ```
  handlers:
    console:
      class : logging.StreamHandler
      formatter: brief
      level   : INFO
      filters: [allow_foo]
      stream  : ext://sys.stdout
    file:
      class : logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
      formatter: precise
      filename: logconfig.log
      maxBytes: 1024
      backupCount: 3
  ```

  the handler with id `console` is instantiated as a
  [`logging.StreamHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler "logging.StreamHandler"), using `sys.stdout` as the underlying
