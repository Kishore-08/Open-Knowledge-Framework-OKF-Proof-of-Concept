# `random` — Generate pseudo-random numbers[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#module-random "Link to this heading")

**Source code:** [Lib/random.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/random.py)

This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various
distributions.

For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences, there is
uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random
permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without
replacement.

On the real line, there are functions to compute uniform, normal (Gaussian),
lognormal, negative exponential, gamma, and beta distributions. For generating
distributions of angles, the von Mises distribution is available.

Almost all module functions depend on the basic function [`random()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.random "random.random"), which
generates a random float uniformly in the half-open range `0.0 <= X < 1.0`.
Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator. It produces 53-bit precision
floats and has a period of 2\*\*19937-1. The underlying implementation in C is
both fast and threadsafe. The Mersenne Twister is one of the most extensively
tested random number generators in existence. However, being completely
deterministic, it is not suitable for all purposes, and is completely unsuitable
for cryptographic purposes.

The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden
instance of the [`random.Random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.Random "random.Random") class. You can instantiate your own
instances of [`Random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.Random "random.Random") to get generators that don’t share state.

Class [`Random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.Random "random.Random") can also be subclassed if you want to use a different
basic generator of your own devising: see the documentation on that class for
more details.

The `random` module also provides the [`SystemRandom`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.SystemRandom "random.SystemRandom") class which
uses the system function [`os.urandom()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.urandom "os.urandom") to generate random numbers
from sources provided by the operating system.

Warning

The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for
security purposes. For security or cryptographic uses, see the
[`secrets`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#module-secrets "secrets: Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets.") module.

Note

The global random number generator and instances of [`Random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.Random "random.Random") are thread-safe.
However, in the free-threaded build, concurrent calls to the global generator or
to the same instance of `Random` may encounter contention and poor performance.
Consider using separate instances of `Random` per thread instead.
