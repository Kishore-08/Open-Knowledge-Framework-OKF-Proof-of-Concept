## QueueListener[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#queuelistener "Link to this heading")

Added in version 3.2.

The [`QueueListener`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.QueueListener "logging.handlers.QueueListener") class, located in the `logging.handlers`
module, supports receiving logging messages from a queue, such as those
implemented in the [`queue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#module-queue "queue: A synchronized queue class.") or [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") modules. The
messages are received from a queue in an internal thread and passed, on
the same thread, to one or more handlers for processing. While
`QueueListener` is not itself a handler, it is documented here
because it works hand-in-hand with [`QueueHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.QueueHandler "logging.handlers.QueueHandler").

Along with the [`QueueHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.QueueHandler "logging.handlers.QueueHandler") class, [`QueueListener`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.QueueListener "logging.handlers.QueueListener") can be used
to let handlers do their work on a separate thread from the one which does the
logging. This is important in web applications and also other service
applications where threads servicing clients need to respond as quickly as
possible, while any potentially slow operations (such as sending an email via
[`SMTPHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.SMTPHandler "logging.handlers.SMTPHandler")) are done on a separate thread.

*class* logging.handlers.QueueListener(*queue*, *\*handlers*, *respect\_handler\_level=False*)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.QueueListener "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a new instance of the `QueueListener` class. The instance is
    initialized with the queue to send messages to and a list of handlers which
    will handle entries placed on the queue. The queue can be any queue-like
    object; it’s passed as-is to the [`dequeue()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.QueueListener.dequeue "logging.handlers.QueueListener.dequeue") method, which needs
    to know how to get messages from it. The queue is not *required* to have the
    task tracking API (though it’s used if available), which means that you can
    use [`SimpleQueue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.SimpleQueue "queue.SimpleQueue") instances for *queue*.

    Note

    If you are using [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism."), you should avoid using
    [`SimpleQueue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.SimpleQueue "queue.SimpleQueue") and instead use [`multiprocessing.Queue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue").

    If `respect_handler_level` is `True`, a handler’s level is respected
    (compared with the level for the message) when deciding whether to pass
    messages to that handler; otherwise, the behaviour is as in previous Python
    versions - to always pass each message to each handler.

    Changed in version 3.5: The `respect_handler_level` argument was added.

    Changed in version 3.14: `QueueListener` can now be used as a context manager via
    [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with). When entering the context, the listener is started. When
    exiting the context, the listener is stopped.
    [`__enter__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__enter__ "contextmanager.__enter__") returns the
    `Queue
