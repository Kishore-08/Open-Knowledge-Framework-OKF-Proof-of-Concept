## Itertool Functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertool-functions "Link to this heading")

The following functions all construct and return iterators. Some provide
streams of infinite length, so they should only be accessed by functions or
loops that truncate the stream.

itertools.accumulate(*iterable*[, *function*, *\**, *initial=None*])[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.accumulate "Link to this definition")
:   Make an iterator that returns accumulated sums or accumulated
    results from other binary functions.

    The *function* defaults to addition. The *function* should accept
    two arguments, an accumulated total and a value from the *iterable*.

    If an *initial* value is provided, the accumulation will start with
    that value and the output will have one more element than the input
    iterable.

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    def accumulate(iterable, function=operator.add, *, initial=None):
        'Return running totals'
        # accumulate([1,2,3,4,5]) → 1 3 6 10 15
        # accumulate([1,2,3,4,5], initial=100) → 100 101 103 106 110 115
        # accumulate([1,2,3,4,5], operator.mul) → 1 2 6 24 120

        iterator = iter(iterable)
        total = initial
        if initial is None:
            try:
                total = next(iterator)
            except StopIteration:
                return

        yield total
        for element in iterator:
            total = function(total, element)
            yield total
    ```

    To compute a running minimum, set *function* to [`min()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min "min").
    For a running maximum, set *function* to [`max()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max "max").
    Or for a running product, set *function* to [`operator.mul()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.mul "operator.mul").
    To build an [amortization table](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/real-estate/amortization-schedule),
    accumulate the interest and apply payments:

    ```
    >>> data = [3, 4, 6, 2, 1, 9, 0, 7, 5, 8]
    >>> list(accumulate(data, max))              # running maximum
    [3, 4, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
    >>> list(accumulate(data, operator.mul))     # running product
    [3, 12, 72, 144, 144, 1296, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    # Amortize a 5% loan of 1000 with 10 annual payments of 90
    >>> update = lambda balance, payment: round(balance * 1.05) - payment
    >>> list(accumulate(repeat(90, 10), update, initial=1_000))
    [1000, 960, 918, 874, 828, 779, 728, 674, 618, 559, 497]
    ```

    See [`functools.reduce()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce "functools.reduce") for a similar function that returns only the
    final accumulated value.

    Added in version 3.2.

    Changed in version 3.3: Added the optional *function* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.8: Added the optional *initial* parameter.

itertools.batched(*iterable*, *n*, *\**, *strict=False*)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.batched "Link to this definition")
:   Batch data from the *iterable* into tuples of length *n*. The last
    batch may be shorter than *n*.

    If *strict* is true, will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the final
    batch is shorter than *n*.

    Loops over the input iterable and accumulates data into tuples up to
    size *n*. The input is consumed lazily, just enough to fill a batch.
    The result is yielded as soon as the batch is full or when the input
    iterable is exhausted:

    ```
    >>> flattened_data = ['roses', 'red', 'violets', 'blue', 'sugar', 'sweet']
    >>> unflattened = list(batched(flattened_data, 2))
    >>> unflattened
    [('roses', 'red'), ('violets', 'blue'), ('sugar', 'sweet')]
    ```

    Roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    def batched(iterable, n, *, strict=False):
        # batched('ABCDEFG', 3)
