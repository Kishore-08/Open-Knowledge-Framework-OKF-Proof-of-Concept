### Naive bayesian classifier[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#naive-bayesian-classifier "Link to this heading")

Normal distributions commonly arise in machine learning problems.

Wikipedia has a [nice example of a Naive Bayesian Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Person_classification).
The challenge is to predict a person’s gender from measurements of normally
distributed features including height, weight, and foot size.

We’re given a training dataset with measurements for eight people. The
measurements are assumed to be normally distributed, so we summarize the data
with [`NormalDist`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.NormalDist "statistics.NormalDist"):

```
>>> height_male = NormalDist.from_samples([6, 5.92, 5.58, 5.92])
>>> height_female = NormalDist.from_samples([5, 5.5, 5.42, 5.75])
>>> weight_male = NormalDist.from_samples([180, 190, 170, 165])
>>> weight_female = NormalDist.from_samples([100, 150, 130, 150])
>>> foot_size_male = NormalDist.from_samples([12, 11, 12, 10])
>>> foot_size_female = NormalDist.from_samples([6, 8, 7, 9])
```

Next, we encounter a new person whose feature measurements are known but whose
gender is unknown:

```
>>> ht = 6.0        # height
>>> wt = 130        # weight
>>> fs = 8          # foot size
```

Starting with a 50% [prior probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability) of being male or female,
we compute the posterior as the prior times the product of likelihoods for the
feature measurements given the gender:

```
>>> prior_male = 0.5
>>> prior_female = 0.5
>>> posterior_male = (prior_male * height_male.pdf(ht) *
...                   weight_male.pdf(wt) * foot_size_male.pdf(fs))

>>> posterior_female = (prior_female * height_female.pdf(ht) *
...                     weight_female.pdf(wt) * foot_size_female.pdf(fs))
```

The final prediction goes to the largest posterior. This is known as the
[maximum a posteriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation) or MAP:

```
>>> 'male' if posterior_male > posterior_female else 'female'
'female'
```
