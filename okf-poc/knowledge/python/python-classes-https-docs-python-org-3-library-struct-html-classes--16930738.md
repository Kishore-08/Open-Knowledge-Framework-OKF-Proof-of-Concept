## Classes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#classes "Link to this heading")

The `struct` module also defines the following type:

*class* struct.Struct(*format*)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct "Link to this definition")
:   Return a new Struct object which writes and reads binary data according to
    the format string *format*. Creating a `Struct` object once and calling its
    methods is more efficient than calling module-level functions with the
    same format since the format string is only compiled once.

    Note

    The compiled versions of the most recent format strings passed to
    the module-level functions are cached, so programs that use only a few
    format strings needn’t worry about reusing a single `Struct`
    instance.

    Compiled Struct objects support the following methods and attributes:

    pack(*v1*, *v2*, *...*)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.pack "Link to this definition")
    :   Identical to the [`pack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack "struct.pack") function, using the compiled format.
        (`len(result)` will equal [`size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "struct.Struct.size").)

    pack\_into(*buffer*, *offset*, *v1*, *v2*, *...*)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.pack_into "Link to this definition")
    :   Identical to the [`pack_into()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack_into "struct.pack_into") function, using the compiled format.

    unpack(*buffer*)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.unpack "Link to this definition")
    :   Identical to the [`unpack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.unpack "struct.unpack") function, using the compiled format.
        The buffer’s size in bytes must equal [`size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "struct.Struct.size").

    unpack\_from(*buffer*, *offset=0*)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.unpack_from "Link to this definition")
    :   Identical to the [`unpack_from()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.unpack_from "struct.unpack_from") function, using the compiled format.
        The buffer’s size in bytes, starting at position *offset*, must be at least
        [`size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "struct.Struct.size").

    iter\_unpack(*buffer*)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.iter_unpack "Link to this definition")
    :   Identical to the [`iter_unpack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.iter_unpack "struct.iter_unpack") function, using the compiled format.
        The buffer’s size in bytes must be a multiple of [`size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "struct.Struct.size").

        Added in version 3.4.

    format[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.format "Link to this definition")
    :   The format string used to construct this Struct object.

        Changed in version 3.7: The format string type is now [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") instead of [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    size[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.Struct.size "Link to this definition")
    :   The calculated size of the struct (and hence of the bytes object produced
        by the [`pack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack "struct.pack") method) corresponding to [`format`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format "format").

    Changed in version 3.13: The *repr()* of structs has changed. It
    is now:

    ```
    >>> Struct('i')
    Struct('i')
    ```
