### Implementing the arithmetic operations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#implementing-the-arithmetic-operations "Link to this heading")

We want to implement the arithmetic operations so that mixed-mode
operations either call an implementation whose author knew about the
types of both arguments, or convert both to the nearest built in type
and do the operation there. For subtypes of [`Integral`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Integral "numbers.Integral"), this
means that [`__add__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__ "object.__add__") and [`__radd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__ "object.__radd__") should be
defined as:

```
class MyIntegral(Integral):

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, MyIntegral):
            return do_my_adding_stuff(self, other)
        elif isinstance(other, OtherTypeIKnowAbout):
            return do_my_other_adding_stuff(self, other)
        else:
            return NotImplemented

    def __radd__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, MyIntegral):
            return do_my_adding_stuff(other, self)
        elif isinstance(other, OtherTypeIKnowAbout):
            return do_my_other_adding_stuff(other, self)
        elif isinstance(other, Integral):
            return int(other) + int(self)
        elif isinstance(other, Real):
            return float(other) + float(self)
        elif isinstance(other, Complex):
            return complex(other) + complex(self)
        else:
            return NotImplemented
```

There are 5 different cases for a mixed-type operation on subclasses
of [`Complex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Complex "numbers.Complex"). I’ll refer to all of the above code that doesn’t
refer to `MyIntegral` and `OtherTypeIKnowAbout` as
“boilerplate”. `a` will be an instance of `A`, which is a subtype
of `Complex` (`a : A <: Complex`), and `b : B <:
Complex`. I’ll consider `a + b`:

1. If `A` defines an [`__add__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__ "object.__add__") which accepts `b`, all is
   well.
2. If `A` falls back to the boilerplate code, and it were to
   return a value from [`__add__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__ "object.__add__"), we’d miss the possibility
   that `B` defines a more intelligent [`__radd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__ "object.__radd__"), so the
   boilerplate should return [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") from
   `__add__()`. (Or `A` may not implement `__add__()` at
   all.)
3. Then `B`’s [`__radd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__ "object.__radd__") gets a chance. If it accepts
   `a`, all is well.
4. If it falls back to the boilerplate, there are no more possible
   methods to try, so this is where the default implementation
   should live.
5. If `B <: A`, Python tries `B.__radd__` before
   `A.__add__`. This is ok, because it was implemented with
   knowledge of `A`, so it can handle those instances before
   delegating to [`Complex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Complex "numbers.Complex").

If `A <: Complex` and `B <: Real` without sharing any other knowledge,
then the appropriate shared operation is the one involving the built
in [`complex`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex "complex"), and both [`__radd__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__ "object.__radd__") s land there, so `a+b
== b+a`.

Because most of the operations on any given type will be very similar,
it can be useful to define a helper function which generates the
forward and reverse instances of any given operator. For example,
[`fractions.Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction "fractions.F
