## Process Parameters[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#process-parameters "Link to this heading")

These functions and data items provide information and operate on the current
process and user.

os.ctermid()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.ctermid "Link to this definition")
:   Return the filename corresponding to the controlling terminal of the process.

    [Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): Unix, not WASI.

os.environ[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ "Link to this definition")
:   A [mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping) object where keys and values are strings that represent
    the process environment. For example, `environ['HOME']` is the pathname
    of your home directory (on some platforms), and is equivalent to
    `getenv("HOME")` in C.

    This mapping is captured the first time the `os` module is imported,
    typically during Python startup as part of processing `site.py`. Changes
    to the environment made after this time are not reflected in `os.environ`,
    except for changes made by modifying `os.environ` directly.

    This mapping may be used to modify the environment as well as query the
    environment. [`putenv()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.putenv "os.putenv") will be called automatically when the mapping
    is modified.

    On Unix, keys and values use [`sys.getfilesystemencoding()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding "sys.getfilesystemencoding") and
    `'surrogateescape'` error handler. Use [`environb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environb "os.environb") if you would like
    to use a different encoding.

    On Windows, the keys are converted to uppercase. This also applies when
    getting, setting, or deleting an item. For example,
    `environ['monty'] = 'python'` maps the key `'MONTY'` to the value
    `'python'`.

    Note

    Calling [`putenv()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.putenv "os.putenv") directly does not change `os.environ`, so it’s better
    to modify `os.environ`.

    Note

    On some platforms, including FreeBSD and macOS, setting `environ` may
    cause memory leaks. Refer to the system documentation for
    `putenv()`.

    You can delete items in this mapping to unset environment variables.
    [`unsetenv()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.unsetenv "os.unsetenv") will be called automatically when an item is deleted from
    `os.environ`, and when one of the `pop()` or `clear()` methods is
    called.

    The [`os.reload_environ()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.reload_environ "os.reload_environ") function.

    Changed in version 3.9: Updated to support [**PEP 584**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0584/)’s merge (`|`) and update (`|=`) operators.

os.environb[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environb "Link to this definition")
:   Bytes version of [`environ`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ "os.environ"): a [mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping) object where both keys
    and values are [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") objects representing the process environment.
    `environ` and `environb` are synchronized (modifying
    `environb` updates `environ`, and vice versa).

    `environb` is only available if [`supports_bytes_environ`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.supports_bytes_environ "os.supports_bytes_environ") is
    `True`.

    Added in version 3.2.
