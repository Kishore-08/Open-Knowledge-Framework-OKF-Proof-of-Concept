### Dictionary view objects[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dictionary-view-objects "Link to this heading")

The objects returned by [`dict.keys()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.keys "dict.keys"), [`dict.values()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.values "dict.values") and
[`dict.items()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items "dict.items") are *view objects*. They provide a dynamic view on the
dictionary’s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view
reflects these changes.

Dictionary views can be iterated over to yield their respective data, and
support membership tests:

len(dictview)
:   Return the number of entries in the dictionary.

iter(dictview)
:   Return an iterator over the keys, values or items (represented as tuples of
    `(key, value)`) in the dictionary.

    Keys and values are iterated over in insertion order.
    This allows the creation of `(value, key)` pairs
    using [`zip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip "zip"): `pairs = zip(d.values(), d.keys())`. Another way to
    create the same list is `pairs = [(v, k) for (k, v) in d.items()]`.

    Iterating views while adding or deleting entries in the dictionary may raise
    a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") or fail to iterate over all entries.

    Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.

x in dictview
:   Return `True` if *x* is in the underlying dictionary’s keys, values or
    items (in the latter case, *x* should be a `(key, value)` tuple).

reversed(dictview)
:   Return a reverse iterator over the keys, values or items of the dictionary.
    The view will be iterated in reverse order of the insertion.

    Changed in version 3.8: Dictionary views are now reversible.

dictview.mapping
:   Return a [`types.MappingProxyType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.MappingProxyType "types.MappingProxyType") that wraps the original
    dictionary to which the view refers.

    Added in version 3.10.

Keys views are set-like since their entries are unique and [hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable).
Items views also have set-like operations since the (key, value) pairs
are unique and the keys are hashable.
If all values in an items view are hashable as well,
then the items view can interoperate with other sets.
(Values views are not treated as set-like
since the entries are generally not unique.) For set-like views, all of the
operations defined for the abstract base class [`collections.abc.Set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Set "collections.abc.Set") are
available (for example, `==`, `<`, or `^`). While using set operators,
set-like views accept any iterable as the other operand,
unlike sets which only accept sets as the input.

An example of dictionary view usage:

```
>>> dishes = {'eggs': 2, 'sausage': 1, 'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500}
>>> keys = dishes.keys()
>>> values = dishes.values()

>>> # iteration
>>> n = 0
>>> for val in values:
...     n += val
...
>>> print(n)
504

>>> # keys and values are iterated over in the same order (insertion order)
>>> list(keys)
['eggs', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam']
>>> list(values)
[2, 1, 1, 500]

>>> # view objects are dynamic and reflect dict changes
>>> del dishes['eggs']
>>> del dishes['sausage']
>>> list(keys)
['bacon', 'spam']

>>> # set operations
>>> keys & {'eggs', 'bacon', 'salad'}
{'bacon'}
>>> keys ^ {'sausage', 'juice'} == {'juice', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam'}
True
>>> keys | ['juice', 'juice', 'juice'] == {'bacon', 'spam', 'juice'}
True

>>> # get back a read-only proxy for the original dictionary
>>> values.mapping
mappingproxy({'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500})
>>> values.mapping['spam']
500
```
