# `statistics` — Mathematical statistics functions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#module-statistics "Link to this heading")

Added in version 3.4.

**Source code:** [Lib/statistics.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/statistics.py)

---

This module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of
numeric ([`Real`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Real "numbers.Real")-valued) data.

The module is not intended to be a competitor to third-party libraries such
as [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), or
proprietary full-featured statistics packages aimed at professional
statisticians such as Minitab, SAS and Matlab. It is aimed at the level of
graphing and scientific calculators.

Unless explicitly noted, these functions support [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int"),
[`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "float"), [`Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") and [`Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction "fractions.Fraction").
Behaviour with other types (whether in the numeric tower or not) is
currently unsupported. Collections with a mix of types are also undefined
and implementation-dependent. If your input data consists of mixed types,
you may be able to use [`map()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map "map") to ensure a consistent result, for
example: `map(float, input_data)`.

Some datasets use `NaN` (not a number) values to represent missing data.
Since NaNs have unusual comparison semantics, they cause surprising or
undefined behaviors in the statistics functions that sort data or that count
occurrences. The functions affected are `median()`, `median_low()`,
`median_high()`, `median_grouped()`, `mode()`, `multimode()`, and
`quantiles()`. The `NaN` values should be stripped before calling these
functions:

```
>>> from statistics import median
>>> from math import isnan
>>> from itertools import filterfalse

>>> data = [20.7, float('NaN'),19.2, 18.3, float('NaN'), 14.4]
>>> sorted(data)  # This has surprising behavior
[20.7, nan, 14.4, 18.3, 19.2, nan]
>>> median(data)  # This result is unexpected
16.35

>>> sum(map(isnan, data))    # Number of missing values
2
>>> clean = list(filterfalse(isnan, data))  # Strip NaN values
>>> clean
[20.7, 19.2, 18.3, 14.4]
>>> sorted(clean)  # Sorting now works as expected
[14.4, 18.3, 19.2, 20.7]
>>> median(clean)       # This result is now well defined
18.75
```
