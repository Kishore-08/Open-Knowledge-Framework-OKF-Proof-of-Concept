## Dependency Injection[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/background-tasks/#dependency-injection "Permanent link")

Using `BackgroundTasks` also works with the dependency injection system, you can declare a parameter of type `BackgroundTasks` at multiple levels: in a *path operation function*, in a dependency (dependable), in a sub-dependency, etc.

**FastAPI** knows what to do in each case and how to reuse the same object, so that all the background tasks are merged together and are run in the background afterwards:

Python 3.10+

```
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import BackgroundTasks, Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


def write_log(message: str):
    with open("log.txt", mode="a") as log:
        log.write(message)


def get_query(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, q: str | None = None):
    if q:
        message = f"found query: {q}\n"
        background_tasks.add_task(write_log, message)
    return q


@app.post("/send-notification/{email}")
async def send_notification(
    email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, q: Annotated[str, Depends(get_query)]
):
    message = f"message to {email}\n"
    background_tasks.add_task(write_log, message)
    return {"message": "Message sent"}
```

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.10+ - non-Annotated

Tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

```
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks, Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


def write_log(message: str):
    with open("log.txt", mode="a") as log:
        log.write(message)


def get_query(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, q: str | None = None):
    if q:
        message = f"found query: {q}\n"
        background_tasks.add_task(write_log, message)
    return q


@app.post("/send-notification/{email}")
async def send_notification(
    email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, q: str = Depends(get_query)
):
    message = f"message to {email}\n"
    background_tasks.add_task(write_log, message)
    return {"message": "Message sent"}
```

In this example, the messages will be written to the `log.txt` file *after* the response is sent.

If there was a query in the request, it will be written to the log in a background task.

And then another background task generated at the *path operation function* will write a message using the `email` path parameter.
