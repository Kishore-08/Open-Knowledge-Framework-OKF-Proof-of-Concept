## Multiple body parameters[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-multiple-params/#multiple-body-parameters "Permanent link")

In the previous example, the *path operations* would expect a JSON body with the attributes of an `Item`, like:

```
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2
}
```

But you can also declare multiple body parameters, e.g. `item` and `user`:

Python 3.10+

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None


class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    full_name: str | None = None


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item, user: User):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item, "user": user}
    return results
```

In this case, **FastAPI** will notice that there is more than one body parameter in the function (there are two parameters that are Pydantic models).

So, it will then use the parameter names as keys (field names) in the body, and expect a body like:

```
{
    "item": {
        "name": "Foo",
        "description": "The pretender",
        "price": 42.0,
        "tax": 3.2
    },
    "user": {
        "username": "dave",
        "full_name": "Dave Grohl"
    }
}
```

Note

Notice that even though the `item` was declared the same way as before, it is now expected to be inside of the body with a key `item`.

**FastAPI** will do the automatic conversion from the request, so that the parameter `item` receives its specific content and the same for `user`.

It will perform the validation of the compound data, and will document it like that for the OpenAPI schema and automatic docs.
