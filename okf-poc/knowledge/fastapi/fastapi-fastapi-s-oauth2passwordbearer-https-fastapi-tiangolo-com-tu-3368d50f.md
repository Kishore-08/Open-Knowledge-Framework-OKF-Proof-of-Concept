## **FastAPI**'s `OAuth2PasswordBearer`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/first-steps/#fastapis-oauth2passwordbearer "Permanent link")

**FastAPI** provides several tools, at different levels of abstraction, to implement these security features.

In this example we are going to use **OAuth2**, with the **Password** flow, using a **Bearer** token. We do that using the `OAuth2PasswordBearer` class.

Note

A "bearer" token is not the only option.

But it's the best one for our use case.

And it might be the best for most use cases, unless you are an OAuth2 expert and know exactly why there's another option that better suits your needs.

In that case, **FastAPI** also provides you with the tools to build it.

When we create an instance of the `OAuth2PasswordBearer` class we pass in the `tokenUrl` parameter. This parameter contains the URL that the client (the frontend running in the user's browser) will use to send the `username` and `password` in order to get a token.

Python 3.10+

```
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(token: Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]):
    return {"token": token}
```

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.10+ - non-Annotated

Tip

Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

```
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    return {"token": token}
```

Tip

Here `tokenUrl="token"` refers to a relative URL `token` that we haven't created yet. As it's a relative URL, it's equivalent to `./token`.

Because we are using a relative URL, if your API was located at `https://example.com/`, then it would refer to `https://example.com/token`. But if your API was located at `https://example.com/api/v1/`, then it would refer to `https://example.com/api/v1/token`.

Using a relative URL is important to make sure your application keeps working even in an advanced use case like [Behind a Proxy](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/behind-a-proxy/).

This parameter doesn't create that endpoint / *path operation*, but declares that the URL `/token` will be the one that the client should use to get the token. That information is used in OpenAPI, and then in the interactive API documentation systems.

We will soon also create the actual path operation.

Note

If you are a very strict "Pythonista" you might dislike the style of the parameter name `tokenUrl` instead of `token_url`.

That's because it is using the same name as in the OpenAPI spec. So that if you need to investigate more about any of these security schemes you can just copy and paste it to find more information about it.

The `oauth2_scheme` variable is an instance of `OAuth2PasswordBearer`, but it is also a "callable".

It could be called as:

```
oauth2_scheme(some, parameters)
```

So, it can be used with `Depends`.
