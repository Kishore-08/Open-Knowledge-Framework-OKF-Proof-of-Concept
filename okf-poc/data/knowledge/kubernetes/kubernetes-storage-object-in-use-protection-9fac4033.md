### Storage Object in Use Protection

The purpose of the Storage Object in Use Protection feature is to ensure that
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) in active use by a Pod and PersistentVolume (PVs)
that are bound to PVCs are not removed from the system, as this may result in data loss.

#### Note:

PVC is in active use by a Pod when a Pod object exists that is using the PVC.

If a user deletes a PVC in active use by a Pod, the PVC is not removed immediately.
PVC removal is postponed until the PVC is no longer actively used by any Pods. Also,
if an admin deletes a PV that is bound to a PVC, the PV is not removed immediately.
PV removal is postponed until the PV is no longer bound to a PVC.

You can see that a PVC is protected when the PVC's status is `Terminating` and the
`Finalizers` list includes `kubernetes.io/pvc-protection`:

```
kubectl describe pvc hostpath
Name:          hostpath
Namespace:     default
StorageClass:  example-hostpath
Status:        Terminating
Volume:
Labels:        <none>
Annotations:   volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class=example-hostpath
               volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner=example.com/hostpath
Finalizers:    [kubernetes.io/pvc-protection]
...
```

You can see that a PV is protected when the PV's status is `Terminating` and
the `Finalizers` list includes `kubernetes.io/pv-protection` too:

```
kubectl describe pv task-pv-volume
Name:            task-pv-volume

Annotations:     <none>
