### Workload placement considerations

The placement of workloads, including the control plane components, can vary based on cluster size,
performance requirements, and operational policies:

- In smaller or development clusters, control plane components and user workloads might run on the same nodes.
- Larger production clusters often dedicate specific nodes to control plane components,
  separating them from user workloads.
- Some organizations run critical add-ons or monitoring tools on control plane nodes.

### Cluster management tools

Tools like kubeadm, kops, and Kubespray offer different approaches to deploying and managing clusters,
each with its own method of component layout and management.
