## Read-only mounts

A mount can be made read-only by setting the `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts[*].readOnly`
field to `true`.
This does not make the volume itself read-only, but that specific container will
not be able to write to it.
Other containers in the Pod may mount the same volume as read-write.

On Linux, read-only mounts are not recursively read-only by default.
For example, consider a Pod that mounts the hosts `/mnt` as a `hostPath` volume. If
there is another filesystem mounted read-write on `/mnt/<SUBMOUNT>` (such as tmpfs,
NFS, or USB storage), the volume mounted into the container(s) will also have a writeable
`/mnt/<SUBMOUNT>`, even if the mount itself was specified as read-only.
