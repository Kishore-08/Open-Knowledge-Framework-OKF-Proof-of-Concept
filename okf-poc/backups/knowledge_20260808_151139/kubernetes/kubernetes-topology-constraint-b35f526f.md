### Topology constraint

To define a topology constraint for a PodGroup you need to set a `key`, which corresponds to
a Kubernetes node label, representing the target topology domain (for example, a rack or a zone).
The scheduler strictly enforces that all pods within the PodGroup are placed onto nodes that share
the exact same value for this specified label.

Here is an example of a PodGroup configured with a topology constraint:

```
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: PodGroup
metadata:
  name: example-podgroup
spec:
  schedulingPolicy:
    gang:
      minCount: 4
  schedulingConstraints:
    topology:
      - key: topology.example.com/rack
```
