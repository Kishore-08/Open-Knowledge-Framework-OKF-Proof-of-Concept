### Authentication, authorization, and auditing

CRDs always use the same authentication, authorization, and audit logging as the built-in
resources of your API server.

If you use RBAC for authorization, most RBAC roles will not grant access to the new resources
(except the cluster-admin role or any role created with wildcard rules). You'll need to explicitly
grant access to the new resources. CRDs and Aggregated APIs often come bundled with new role
definitions for the types they add.

Aggregated API servers may or may not use the same authentication, authorization, and auditing as
the primary API server.
