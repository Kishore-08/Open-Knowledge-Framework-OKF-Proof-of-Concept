## Creation ordering

Controllers must create objects in this order:

1. `Workload` — the scheduling policy template.
2. `PodGroup` — the runtime instance.
3. `Pods` — with `spec.schedulingGroup.podGroupName` pointing to the `PodGroup`.

If a `PodGroup` includes a `podGroupTemplateRef` that points to a `Workload` that does
not exist (or is being deleted), the API server rejects the `PodGroup` creation request.
The referenced `Workload` must exist before the `PodGroup` can be created.

If a `Pod` references a `PodGroup` that does not yet exist, the `Pod` remains pending.
The scheduler automatically queues the `Pod` for scheduling once the `PodGroup` is created.
