## Non-Template Pod acquisitions

While you can create bare Pods with no problems, it is strongly recommended to make sure that the bare Pods do not have
labels which match the selector of one of your ReplicaSets. The reason for this is because a ReplicaSet is not limited
to owning Pods specified by its template-- it can acquire other Pods in the manner specified in the previous sections.

Take the previous frontend ReplicaSet example, and the Pods specified in the following manifest:

[`pods/pod-rs.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/pods/pod-rs.yaml)![](https://kubernetes.io/images/copycode.svg "Copy pods/pod-rs.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hello1
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod2
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hello2
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
```

As those Pods do not have a Controller (or any object) as their owner reference and match the selector of the frontend
ReplicaSet, they will immediately be acquired by it.

Suppose you create the Pods after the frontend ReplicaSet has been deployed and has set up its initial Pod replicas to
fulfill its replica count requirement:

```
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/pods/pod-rs.yaml
```

The new Pods will be acquired by the ReplicaSet, and then immediately terminated as the ReplicaSet would be over
its desired count.

Fetching the Pods:

```
kubectl get pods
```

The output shows that the new Pods are either already terminated, or in the process of being terminated:

```
NAME             READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-b2zdv   1/1     Running       0          10m
frontend-vcmts   1/1     Running       0          10m
frontend-wtsmm   1/1     Running       0          10m
pod1             0/1     Terminating   0          1s
pod2             0/1     Terminating   0          1s
```

If you create the Pods first:

```
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/pods/pod-rs.yaml
```

And then create the ReplicaSet however:

```
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/controllers/frontend.yaml
```

You shall see that the ReplicaSet has acquired the Pods and has only created new ones according to its spec until the
number of its new Pods and the original matches its desired count. As fetching the Pods:

```
kubectl get pods
```

Will reveal in its output:

```
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-hmmj2   1/1     Running   0          9s
pod1             1/1     Running   0          36s
pod2             1/1     Running   0          36s
```

In this manner, a ReplicaSet can own a non-homogeneous set of Pods
